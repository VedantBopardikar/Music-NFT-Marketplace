This is a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a focus on music. The contract is implemented in the Solidity programming language and is based on the ERC-721 standard. The contract allows users to buy and sell NFTs, with the artist and contract owner receiving a royalty for each sale. The contract also allows the contract owner to update the royalty fee and retrieve a list of unsold tokens.
